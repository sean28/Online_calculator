# Online calculator
<div style="text-align: justify"> When doing computational chemistry, the conversion of various units is a headache, especially when accurate values are really needed. The online calculator developed by jerkwin is very easy to use. His github link is here (https://github.com/Jerkwin/gmxtools). However, the webpage of the calculator crashed and could not be logged in. So, I redeployed this online tool in my repository and you can use this tool for free by clicking <a href="https://sean28.github.io/Online_calculator/">here</a>. Besides, I added a new unit conversion in this calculator, nM(nmol/L). If there is infringement, please contact to delete.</div>
